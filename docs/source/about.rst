There are many websites that provide airline flight tracking and related information. One of the popular sites is flightradar24.
Many enthusiasts use this site to get data related to an airline or particular flight and analyze it. This is largely a manual
process because there is no official API.

The origin of pyflightdata is from one such analysis project. Couple of years ago while working on a small project to analyze
airline routes we found that getting the data manually was a huge drag and decided to automate it with simple python scripts.
That initial version of the code has been fine tuned and enhanced from time to time till it reached the current state.

pyflightdata is maintained on a best effort basis where we fix issues as and when we find them in our use and from the users.
There is no fixed schedule to reconcile with the changes that might happen on flightradar24 and keep up with them. We might add
other data sources in the future but the overall interface will be remain same from the users point of view.

Please feel free to reach out to us by raising issues on our github page.
