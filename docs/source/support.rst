Supporting us
=============

This API is maintained in our free time and we are constantly trying to keep up with the changes in the underlying data source
and also add more data/features where possible. We want to do as much as we can to make it easy for you to get and use the data.

If you are a regular user and if this helps you focus on getting your work done rather than worry about how to get the data, 
then please consider supporting us with a donation at `PayPal <https://www.paypal.me/hariallamraju>`_. 

The amount is of your choice, whatever you feel is enough to show your appreciation for
the work that goes into pyflightdata.
