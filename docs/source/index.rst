Welcome to pyflightdata's documentation!
========================================

At the moment these docs serve as the API docs, the functionality is documented in a README file on the github repo.
Please refer to that here - https://github.com/supercoderz/pyflightdata/blob/master/README.md

Eventually this page will be enhanced and serve as the main documentation.
