Fair usage of the API
=====================

The information from flightradar24 is very valuable for users and the team there does a wonderful job of keeping the data correct and live.
This API makes simple calls as one would make from a browser to get the data. There is no optimization for performance or throttling.

We trust the users to be aware of that fact that any large scale data extraction done using this API and without reasonable throttling
might result in consequences like being blocked fro flightradar24 or having the user account suspended.

Also this is just a wrapper for flighradar24 and does not change or add to the terms and conditions already enforced on the users by flightradar24.

Please make sure that whatever you do, you use the API in a fair manner and do not break the terms of flightradar24.
